# Daquiri Project
## Purpose
Create an easily configurable, highly customizable data aquisition library for arduino microprocessors. This project creates a pipeline that handles data aquisition and data transformations for arduino based sensors. The idea is to create an open source plugin based platform. Data aquisition plugins should be easily created with the code base. 

## Initial Start
Currently the code base is in the infant stages of development with many undeveloped ideas and architectural decisions that still have to be made. 

## Current thoughts
1. Multiple processor support?
1. Inheritance issues?
1. Space issues... How to make it clean as possible for arduinos small memory
1. Automated build process
	1. Arduinos CLI
	1. Python to generate boiler plate code
